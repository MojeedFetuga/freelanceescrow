# **Freelance Payment Escrow System**

## **Overview**

The **Freelance Payment Escrow System** is a smart contract designed to provide secure and transparent transactions between clients and freelancers. This contract ensures that payments are safely held in escrow until both parties have completed their agreed-upon tasks. It helps eliminate trust issues and provides security for both clients and freelancers in freelance work agreements.

### **Key Features**
- **Escrow Payment:** Funds are deposited into the contract and only released when both parties fulfill their obligations.
- **Client and Freelancer Roles:** Different functions and permissions for clients and freelancers.
- **Job Completion Confirmation:** Both parties must agree that the job has been completed before funds are released.
- **Secure Withdrawals:** Only the intended recipient (freelancer or client) can withdraw funds after fulfilling the contract's terms.
